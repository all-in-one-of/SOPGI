# SOPGI OTL
SOPGI has been developed usin VEX on a NonCommercial version of SideFX Houdini 16.x.x
and so it will convert your current Houdini session to NonCommercial as soon as you
lay done one of its Nodes as it was more of a proof of concept.

Next iteration will hopefully be better in the overall algorithm
and will be released for the commercial edition of Houdini.
It is for now a never ending work in progress...done in the spare time.
